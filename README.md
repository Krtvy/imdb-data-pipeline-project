# 🎬 IMDb Data Engineering & EDA Pipeline Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full **End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline** built on IMDb dataset.  
We have performed:

- ✅ Multi-source file integration (`movies_metadata.csv` + `credits.csv`)
- ✅ Nested JSON parsing (genres, cast, crew)
- ✅ Actors & Directors extraction
- ✅ Chunked batch processing (handling large files + memory limits)
- ✅ Data Cleaning, Wrangling and Merging
- ✅ Full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ✅ Beautiful visualizations for insights discovery
- ✅ Google Colab compatible notebooks for cloud execution

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- AST module (for stringified JSON parsing)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- Google Colab (Cloud-based execution)
- GitHub (Version control and sharing)

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

- Top Genres Analysis
- Top Directors by Revenue
- Top Actors by Revenue
- Year-wise Movies Production Trend
- Budget vs Revenue Correlation
